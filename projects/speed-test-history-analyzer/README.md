# speed_test_history_analyzer

Analyzes and visualizes the speed test history of an internet connection, calculating average download and upload speeds over time and displaying the results in a simple bar chart.

## Requirements

Install the powershell runtime. No dependency installation has been performed.
This project is planned to use standard language facilities; inspect source imports before running.

## Run

```text
powershell -NoProfile -File main.ps1
```

Supply any command-line arguments required by the source. GUI projects open a desktop window. Review the source before running.

## Project files

- `main.ps1`

## Implemented tasks

- main.ps1: Analyze speed test history, calculate average speeds, and display results in a bar chart.

## Validation

Paperclip performs static checks where supported and model QA. Generated code is not automatically execution-tested. A QA approval does not guarantee runtime correctness.

## Local diagnostics and privacy

The local `_paperclip/` folder contains PM output, QA, repairs, errors and aborted output for debugging. It is excluded from Git by `.gitignore` and is not included in Paperclip publication snapshots.
Credentials, environments, common local data and personal folders are also ignored. Keep personal data outside source files and review files before publication.
